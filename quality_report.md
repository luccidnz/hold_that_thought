# Quality Report: Hold That Thought

This document outlines the current status of code quality tooling (linters, formatters, tests) and the improvements made to establish a quality baseline.

**NOTE:** Due to sandbox limitations, the tools described here have been configured but **not run**. This report details the *infrastructure* put in place. A developer with a local setup will need to run the tools to see the list of issues and apply formatting.

---

## 1. Frontend (Flutter/Dart)

### Status
- **Linter:** The project already had a linter configured via the `analysis_options.yaml` file, which uses the recommended `flutter_lints` package.
- **Formatter:** Dart's built-in formatter (`dart format`) is available by default with the Flutter SDK.
- **Tests:** The project has a `test/` directory, and the existing CI runs `flutter test`.

### Improvements Made
- No configuration changes were needed as a solid baseline was already in place.

### Recommended Commands
A developer can run the following commands from the root directory:
- **Lint:** `flutter analyze`
- **Format:** `dart format .`
- **Test:** `flutter test`

## 2. Backend (Node.js/Firebase Functions)

### Status
- **Initial State:** The backend in the `functions/` directory had no quality tooling. There were no linters, formatters, or test runners configured.
- **Current State:** A robust quality suite has been added and configured.

### Improvements Made

1.  **Added Dev Dependencies:** The following packages were added to `functions/package.json`:
    - `eslint`: For identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript.
    - `prettier`: For opinionated code formatting.
    - `eslint-config-google`: A widely-used style guide.
    - `eslint-config-prettier`: To disable ESLint rules that conflict with Prettier.

2.  **Added Configuration Files:**
    - `functions/.eslintrc.js`: Configures ESLint to use the `google` preset and integrate with Prettier.
    - `functions/.prettierrc`: Configures Prettier for consistent code style.

3.  **Added NPM Scripts:** The following scripts were added to `functions/package.json`:
    - `lint`: `eslint .` (Runs the linter to check for issues).
    - `lint:fix`: `eslint . --fix` (Automatically fixes lint issues).
    - `format`: `prettier --write \"**/*.js\"` (Formats all JavaScript files).

### Recommendations
A developer should navigate to the `functions/` directory and run `npm install`, then run the following commands to bring the existing code into compliance:
1.  `npm run format`
2.  `npm run lint:fix`
